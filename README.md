# Fingerprint injector
The Fingerprint injector is a sparse javascript library build for stealth override of browser signatures or so-called fingerprints.
This library can inject fingerprints through a unified interface to `playwright` and `puppeteer` controlled browsers.
It is highly recommended to use this library with the Apify `fingerprint-generator` to achieve the best results.

## Installation
At thÃ­s stage of development the `fingerprint-injector` is a standalone private package - soon to be public with some stealthy additions to the code.
The installation process is the same as for the `unblockers`. Please refer to this tutorial - https://www.notion.so/apify/Installing-unblockers-2c0db985c84d45f7a81d1a11d826d263.

```bash
npm install @apify-packages/fingerprint-injector
```

## Usage
This simple example shows how to use fingerprint injector with `browser-pool` and `playwright` firefox browser. Please note that `fingerprint-generator` must be installed from git for now like this: `"fingerprint-generator": "git+https://github.com/apify/fingerprint-generator.git#bayesianGenerator"`

```js
const { PlaywrightPlugin } = require('browser-pool');
const FingerprintGenerator = require('fingerprint-generator');
const FingerprintInjector  = require('@apify-packages/fingerprint-injector');

// An asynchronous IIFE (immediately invoked function expression)
// allows us to use the 'await' keyword.
(async () => {
    const playwrightPlugin = new PlaywrightPlugin(playwright.firefox, pluginOptions);
    
    const fingerprintGenerator = new FingerprintGenerator({
        devices: ['desktop'],
        browsers: [{ name: 'firefox', minVersion: 88 }],
    });

    const { fingerprint } = fingerprintGenerator.getFingerprint();

    const fingerprintInjector = new FingerprintInjector({ fingerprint });
    // Initialize fingerprint - it needs to build its utils script under randomized seed.
    await fingerprintInjector.initialize();

    const launchContext = playwrightPlugin.createLaunchContext();
    const browser = await playwrightPlugin.launch(launchContext);
    // For now this needs to be set manually to the context.
    const context = await browser.newContext({
        userAgent: fingerprintInjector.fingerprint.userAgent,
        locale: fingerprintInjector.fingerprint.navigator.language,
    });
   // Attach fingerprint
   await fingerprintInjector.attachFingerprintToPlaywright(context);

   const page = await context.newPage();
})();
```

#### `fingerprintInjector.initialize()`
Builds utils to be injected with a randomized prefix to the browser

#### `fingerprintInjector.attachFingerprintToPlaywright(browserContext, fingerprint)`
Adds init script to the browser context so the fingerprint is changed before every document creation.
